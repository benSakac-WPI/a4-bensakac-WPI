## React.js Birthday Tracker

https://a4-bensakac-wpi.glitch.me/

This project is a complete redo of my assignment for A2. Nothing is changed except for the use of the React framework. At first, using React was definetly a hindrance because I was using it for the first time, whereas with A2 I already had some experience with vanilla JS. Once I got an understanding of how the React components and classes worked, it made developing the interaction much easier.
